            <p>Definition of terms</p>
            <strong>1. System</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A group of interrelated components working together toward a common goal by accepting inputs and
                    producing outputs in an organized transformation process.</li>
                <li>A series of interrelated elements that performs some activity, function or operation.</li>
                <li>A collection of men, machines and methods organized to accomplish a set of specific functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>2. Analysis</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Used to gain an understanding of an existing system and what is required of it. If there is no
                    existing system, then analysis defines only the requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>3. Design</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposes the new system that meets system’s requirements. This new system may be built afresh or by
                    changing the existing system. Once the design is approved, the system is built.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>4. System Feasibility</strong>
            <p>A test of a system’s proposal based on several criterion. These are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technical Feasibility: Hardware, Software, People ware</li>
                <li>Operational Feasibility: Processes, Procedures and Logic</li>
                <li>Economic Feasibility: Benefits should outweigh the costs </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>5. System Analyst</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Applies to the persons who investigate, analyze, design install and evaluate information systems.
                </li>
                <li>Does the actual work of gathering the necessary data and developing plans for new systems.</li>
                <li>An agent of change where some people may not want change.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>6. Goal of System Analysis and Design</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>To build Computer Based Information Systems (CBIS) that shall meet organizational goals and
                    objectives.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>7. Goal of Systems Analysis and Design</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Is not simply to put in a computer but to improve the system as a whole.</li>
                <li>Analysts must then study the system to see how such goals can be met. This does not always mean
                    putting in a computer system. It can sometimes simply require changes to existing procedures,
                    rearranging workflows or making forms more understandable.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="IT_Framework">
            <header>IT Framework</header>
            <p>This IT framework helps in organizing and understanding how data flows through a system, from its initial
                entry to the final output, with intermediate steps of processing and storage.
                <br>
                Here’s how these stages interact:
            </p>
            <img id="itf" src="TDP_Img/IT_FW.png" alt="IT Framework Diagram">
            <ul>
                <li>Input to Process: Data is fed into the system and processed.</li>
                <li>Process to Storage: The processed data may be saved in storage for later use.</li>
                <li>Storage to Process: When needed, stored data is retrieved and sent back for further processing.
                </li>
                <li>Process to Output: The final processed data is then used to produce the output.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Input</strong>
            <p>This is the initial stage where data or information is introduced into the system. For example, it could
                be user inputs, data files, sensor readings, or any other form of data entry.</p>
            <strong>Process</strong>
            <p>Once the data is input, it is then processed. Processing involves performing operations or computations
                on the data to transform it into a more useful form. This could include calculations, data analysis,
                sorting, or applying algorithms.</p>
            <strong>Storage</strong>
            <p>After processing, the results or intermediate data are often stored. Storage refers to saving this data
                in a database, file system, or other storage medium for future retrieval or use. This stage ensures that
                the processed data is preserved and can be accessed later.</p>
            <strong>Output</strong>
            <p>Finally, the stored data or the result of the processing is used to produce output. Output is the end
                result presented to the user or used for further purposes. It could be a report, a visual display, a
                command sent to another system, or any other form of result that serves the intended purpose.</p>

            <strong>Diagram Desciption</strong>
            <p>Management: This is the top-level entity in your diagram.</p>
            <p>End Users: These are the individuals or groups who use the system.</p>
            <p>System: This is the application or platform being developed or used.</p>
            <p>Programmer: These are the individuals who design, develop, and maintain the system.</p>

            <strong>Relationships</strong>
            <p>Management to End Users: This indicates that management has a direct connection or influence on end users.
                Management may set policies, gather feedback, and make decisions that affect how end users interact with
                the system.</p>
            <p>Management to System: Management is also connected to the system. This implies that management oversees
                or has influence over the system's development, implementation, or usage. They may make strategic
                decisions regarding the system’s objectives and resources.</p>
            <p>Management to Programmer: This connection suggests that management interacts with programmers, possibly
                providing requirements, budgets, and deadlines. Management likely sets the direction and priorities for
                the development team.</p>
            <p>End Users to System: This relationship shows that end users interact directly with the system. They use
                the system to perform tasks or achieve goals.</p>
            <p>System to Programmer: This indicates that the system is a point of interaction or concern for
                programmers. Programmers work on the system, developing and maintaining its features and
                functionalities.</p>
